[h1]A Big Thank You[/h1]
This journey in Early Access has been tremendously gratifying for us and we would like to thank everyone who helped us in getting Slay the Spire where it is today.

Slay the Spire was developed a little over 3 years. The first 2 years through a tiny and private internal test group and of course publicly on Steam in the last year. The constant support in both private and public testing fueled us to work hard and we hope that anyone who plays the game before and after the release can see all the work that we and various contributors poured into the game.

For all of the people who have written reviews, found issues diligently, sent us e-mails of support, retweeted or liked us, modded before and after it was officially supported, made top notch memes, praised and/or criticized us in articles, graced us with beautiful beta art, streamed, created YouTube content, and helped us make connections with various people I say "Thank You" and apologize if anybody was missed.

[h1]Community Fan Art[/h1]
Is it Fan Art or Fanart? We won't be posting these for a while without weekly patches :(. It has been motivating to see these each week and it made our weekly patches so colorful!
